## Ownership
Rust does not have a garbage collector, it manages memory by ownership.

 ### Rules
 * each value has a owner
 * only one owner at a time
 * value will be droped when owner goes out of scope
 
 Some thing to remember  
 * Rust calls "drop" automatically at the closing curly bracket
 * Rust will never automatically create deep copies of data
 * variables are destroyed after
   ```
   let s2 = s1
   ```
 * types as integer (stack) copy == deepcopy
 * tuples only contain types that also implement copy implement copy

Note for Microsoft AI MLOps

# Introduction
## AI 
* machine learning
* anomaly detection
* computer vision
* NLP
* knowledge mining
## Azure
* automatic ML
* Azure ML designer
* data/compute management
* pipelines

## Challenges, Risks
* bias
* errors
* data exposed
* solution not for everyone
* users trust a complex system
* liability for AI-driven decision

## Responsbile AI
* fairness -- reduce bias
* reliability and safety -- reduce errors
* privacy and security -- data exposed
* inclusiveness -- diversity
* transparency
* accountability

# Azure openAI service

# MLOps
to make machine learning lifecycle scalable:

  train -> package -> validate -> deploy -> monitor -> retrain
  
agile planning, source control, automation

## DevOps
goal of MLOps: creating, deploying and monitoring robust and reproducible models
* ML: EDA, feature engineering, model training and tuning
* DEV: plan, create, verify, package
* OPS: release, configure, monitor

### CI/CD
CI: create and verify, include 
* refactor exploratory code into scripts
* linting to ceck errors
* unit testing

CD: package, deploy to pre-production environment, production environment, source control 

Source control: git-based respository (Azure Repos, github repos)

### Agile planning
isolate work into sprints
